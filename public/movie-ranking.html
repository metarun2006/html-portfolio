<h1>The best Movies According to Tarun</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Gangs of Wasseypur</h3>
<p>This movie was released in 2 parts. I really like movie because of the time 
landscape it covers over the different generations of mafia bosses. The location, the dialogues
the background music, the story etc. everything goes hand in hand to make it a cinematic 
masterpiece.</p>

<h3>Baahubali</h3>
<p>Simply amazing stroytelling and music.</p>

<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>Great work of fiction portraying India's freedom struggle against the British rule.
I love the way 2 different characters from different walks of life with conflicting 
priorities, come to know each other and then agaist odds collaborate to fight against
tyranny of British.</p>
